## [get_factory_events.py](get_factory_events.py)

This script gets all the events emitted by the Uniswap Factory contracts, and saves them to the csvs.

* The events from the Uniswap v1 Factory are saved in [uniswap_v1_factory_events.csv](../data/uniswap_v1_factory_events.csv).
* The events from the Uniswap v2 Factory are saved in [uniswap_v2_factory_events.csv](../data/uniswap_v2_factory_events.csv).
* The events from the Uniswap v3 Factory are saved in [uniswap_v3_factory_events.csv](../data/uniswap_v3_factory_events.csv).

The main value of these files is that they provide a complete list of all the Uniswap pool contracts
