# Overview

This repository provides python scripts for collecting data from Uniswap versions 1, 2 and 3.

The code is written in Python using the [web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.

In addition to the code, we provide parsed data in CSV format for easy downloading and analysis.

More details about the data can be found in the [data README](data/README.md).
